# Direction-of-Arrival-Estimation-with-MVDR-and-MUSIC
The aim of the project was to compare the algorithms i.e. the MVDR and MUSIC and infer which stood out in DOA(direction of arrival) estimation problem. We used both techniques to estimate broadside angles for the signals received by a ULA(Uniform Linear Array).MUSIC has better resolution than MVDR, but the number of sources must be known.  The output spatial spectrum was plotted, and found that MUSIC had the best spatial resolution. Next various parameters such as inter array spacing, wavelength etc. were changed to determine the robustness of the algorithm. MUSIC outperformed here as well compared to MVDR.
